     <p><h4>Microsoft is a multinational computer technology corporation. Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975,
  by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico.Its current best-selling products are
  the Microsoft Windows operating system; Microsoft Office, a suite of productivity software; Xbox,
  a line of entertainment of games, music, and video; Bing, a line of search engines; and Microsoft Azure, 
  a cloud services platform.
In 1980, Microsoft formed a partnership with IBM to bundle Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers; 
with that deal, IBM paid Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested Microsoft to develop a new operating system for their computers called OS/2. Microsoft produced that operating system, but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.
As of June 30, 2015, Microsoft has a global annual revenue of US$86.83 Billion and 128,076 employees worldwide.
It develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of software products for computing devices.</h4/><p/>

  <p><h4> Oracle Corporation is an American multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Redwood Shores,
  California. The company sells database software and technology, cloud engineered systems, and enterprise
  software products—particularly its own brands of database management systems. In 2019, Oracle was the
  second-largest software company by revenue and market capitalization.
The company also develops and builds tools for database development and systems of middle-tier software,
 enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, Human Capital Management (HCM) software,
 customer relationship management 
 (CRM) software, and supply chain management (SCM) software.
 Larry Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977 with Bob Miner and Ed Oates under the name
 Software Development Laboratories (SDL).
 Ellison took inspiration from the 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems
 (RDBMS) named "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks." He heard about the IBM System R database 
 from an article in the IBM Research Journal provided by Oates. Ellison wanted to make Oracle's product compatible
 with System R, but failed to do so as IBM kept the error codes for their DBMS a secret. SDL changed its name
 to Relational Software, Inc (RSI) in 1979,
 then again to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1983,
 to align itself more closely with its flagship product Oracle Database. At this stage Bob Miner served as
 the company's senior programmer. On March 12, 1986, the company had its initial public offering.
 In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation,
 officially named Oracle, but sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, the name of the holding company.
 Part of Oracle Corporation's early success arose from using the C programming language to implement its products.
 This eased porting to different operating systems most of which support C.<h4/><p/>

  <p>Apple Inc., formerly Apple Computer, Inc., is a multinational corporation that creates consumer electronics,
  personal computers, servers, and computer software, and is a digital distributor of media content.
  The company also has a chain of retail stores known as Apple Stores. Apple's core product lines are 
  the iPhone smartphone, iPad tablet computer, iPod portable media players, and Macintosh computer line.
  Founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created Apple Computer on April 1, 1976, and incorporated the company on 
  January 3, 1977, in Cupertino, California.
For more than three decades, Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers, 
including the Apple II, Macintosh, and Power Mac lines, but it faced rocky sales and low market share 
during the 1990s. Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1996 after 
his company NeXT was bought by Apple. The following year he became the company's interim CEO,
 which later became permanent.Jobs subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of 
recognizable products and simple design, starting with the original iMac in 1998.
With the introduction of the successful iPod music player in 2001 and iTunes Music 
Store in 2003, Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and 
media sales industries, leading it to drop "Computer" from the company's name in 2007.
 The company is now also known for its iOS range of smart phone, media player, and tablet 
 computer products that began with the iPhone, followed by the iPod Touch and then iPad. As of 
 30 June 2015, Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization,
 with an estimated value of US$1 trillion as of August 2, 2018. Apple's worldwide annual revenue in
 2010 totaled US$65 billion, growing to US$127.8 billion in 2011 and $156 billion in 2012.
 On April 1, 1976, Apple Computer Company was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.
 The company was registered as a California business partnership. Wayne, who worked at Atari as a
 chief draftsman, agreed to become a co-founder of the company in return for a 10% stake.
 However, Wayne was somewhat gun-shy due to the failure of his own venture four years earlier. On April 12,
 less than two weeks after the company's formation, Wayne left Apple, selling his 10% share back to the two
 Steves for only $800 and leaving them as the active primary co-founders.
According to Wozniak, Jobs proposed the name “Apple Computer” when he had just come back from Robert 
Friedland’s All-One Farm in Oregon.Jobs told Walter Isaacson that he was "on one of my fruitarian diets,
" when he conceived of the name and thought "it sounded fun, spirited and not intimidating ... plus, it would 
get us ahead of Atari in the phone book."
Soon after the company was formed, the 
two Steves made one last trip to the Homebrew Computer Club and demonstrated the finished version 
of the Apple I.Paul Terrell, who operated a computer store chain named the Byte Shop, was in 
attendance, and became impressed with the machine. He handed the two Steves his card, and told them to 
"keep in touch." The following day, Jobs dropped in on Terrell at the Byte Shop store in Mountain View,
 and tried to sell him the bare circuit boards for the Apple I.[27] Terrell told Jobs that he was interested 
 in purchasing the machine, but only if it came fully assembled, saying he would order 50 assembled computers
 and pay US$500 each on delivery (equivalent to $2,200 in 2019).Jobs then took the purchase order
 that he had been given from the Byte Shop to Cramer Electronics, a national electronic parts distributor, and 
 ordered the components he needed to assemble the Apple I. The local credit manager asked Jobs how he was going
 to pay for the parts and he replied, "I have this purchase order from the Byte Shop chain of computer stores
 for 50 of my computers and the payment terms are COD. If you give me the parts on net 30-day terms I can build
 and deliver the computers in that time frame, collect my money from Terrell at the Byte Shop and pay you.

   <h1 style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;"><U>SAP</U></h1><br/> <br/>
  <p>SAP abbreviation of "Systems, Applications & Products in Data Processing") is a 
  European multinational software corporation that makes enterprise software to manage 
  business operations and customer relations. The company is especially known for 
  its ERP software. SAP is headquartered in Walldorf, Baden-Württemberg, Germany with regional offices
  in 180 countries. The company has over 425,000 customers in over 180 countries
  When Xerox exited the computer hardware manufacturing industry in 1971,
  it asked IBM to migrate its business systems to IBM technology. As part of IBM's compensation for the migration,
  IBM was given the rights to the Scientific Data Systems (SDS)/SAPE software, reportedly for a
  contract credit of $80,000.
Five IBM engineers from the AI department
 (Dietmar Hopp, Klaus Tschira, Hans-Werner Hector, Hasso Plattner, and Claus Wellenreuther, 
 all from Mannheim, Baden-Württemberg) were working on an enterprise-wide system based on this software, 
 only to be told that it would no longer be necessary. Rather than abandoning the project, 
 they decided to leave IBM Tech and start another company.
 
 In June 1972, they founded the SAP Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung 
 ("System Analysis and Program Development" / "SAPD") company, as a private partnership under the German Civil Code.
 Their first client was the German branch of Imperial Chemical Industries in Östringen,
  where they developed mainframe programs for payroll and accounting. Instead of storing the data
  on punch cards mechanically, as IBM did, they stored it locally in the Electronic System while using a
  common Logical database for all activities of Organization.[clarification needed] Therefore
  , they called their software a real-time system, since there was no need to process the punch 
  cards overnight (for this reason their flagship product carried an R in its name until the late 1990s).
  This first version was also a standalone software that could be offered to other interested parties.<p/>

   <h1 style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;"><U>VMware</U></h1><br/> <br/>
  <p>VMware, Inc. is an American publicly traded software company listed on the NYSE under stock ticker VMW. 
  Dell Technologies is a majority share holder. VMware provides cloud computing and virtualization software and services.
  It was one of the first commercially successful companies to virtualize the x86 architecture.
  VMware's desktop software runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS, while its enterprise software
  hypervisor for servers, VMware ESXi, is a bare-metal hypervisor that runs directly on server hardware
  without requiring an additional underlying operating system.
  The first product, VMware Workstation, was delivered in May 1999, and the company entered the server market in 2001 with VMware GSX Server (hosted) and VMware ESX Server (hostless).[12][13]
In 2003, VMware launched VMware Virtual Center, vMotion, and Virtual SMP technology.
 64-bit support was introduced in 2004.

On January 9, 2004, under the terms of the definitive agreement announced on December 15, 2003, EMC
 (now Dell EMC) acquired the company with $625 million in cash. On August 14, 2007, EMC sold 15%
 of VMware to the public via an initial public offering. Shares were priced at US$29 per share and closed
 the day at US$51.

On July 8, 2008, after disappointing financial performance, the board of directors fired VMware co-founder,
 president and CEO Diane Greene, who was replaced by Paul Maritz, a retired 14-year Microsoft veteran who
 was heading EMC's cloud computing business unit.[18] Greene had been CEO since the company's founding,
 ten years earlier.On September 10, 2008, Mendel Rosenblum, the company's co-founder, chief scientist,
 and the husband of Diane Greene, resigned.

On September 16, 2008, VMware announced a collaboration with Cisco Systems.
 One result was the Cisco Nexus 1000V, a distributed virtual software switch, 
 an integrated option in the VMware infrastructure.

In April 2011, EMC transferred control of the Mozy backup service to VMware.

On April 12, 2011, VMware released an open-source platform-as-a-service system called Cloud Foundry,
 as well as a hosted version of the service. This supported application deployment for Java, Ruby on Rails,
 Sinatra, Node.js, and Scala, as well as database support for MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Postgres, RabbitMQ.

In August 2012, Pat Gelsinger was appointed as the new CEO of VMware, 
coming over from EMC. Paul Maritz went over to EMC as Head of Strategy before moving on to lead the Pivotal spin-off. 
In March 2013, VMware announced the corporate spin-off of Pivotal Software, with General Electric making an investment in 
the company. All of VMware's application- and developer-oriented products, including Spring, tc Server, Cloud Foundry
, RabbitMQ, GemFire, and SQLFire were transferred to this organization.

In May 2013, VMware launched its own IaaS service, vCloud Hybrid Service, at its
 new Palo Alto headquarters (vCloud Hybrid Service was rebranded vCloud Air and 
 subsequently sold to cloud provider OVH), announcing an early access program in a Las Vegas data center. <p/>
