<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"><U>History of programming languages</U></h1>
<p>Ever since the invention of Charles Babbage’s difference engine in 1822, computers have required a means of 
instructing them to perform a specific task.
 This means is known as a programming language. Computer languages were first composed of a series of steps to
 wire a particular program; 
 these morphed into a series of steps keyed into the computer and then executed; later these languages acquired
 advanced features such as logical branching and object orientation. 
 The computer languages of the last fifty years have come in two stages, the first major languages and the second 
 major languages, which are in use today.
In the beginning, Charles Babbage’s difference engine could only be made to execute tasks by changing the gears 
which executed the calculations. Thus, the earliest form of a computer language was physical motion. 
Eventually, physical motion was replaced by electrical signals when the US Government built the ENIAC in 1942.
It followed many of the same principles of Babbage’s engine and hence, could only be “programmed” by presetting
 switches and rewiring the entire system for each new “program” or calculation. This process proved to be very tedious.
In 1945, John Von Neumann was working at the Institute for Advanced Study. He developed two important concepts
 that directly affected the path of computer programming languages. 
The first was known as “shared-program technique” (www.softlord.com). 
This technique stated that the actual computer hardware should be simple and not need to be hand-wired for
 each program. Instead, complex instructions should be used to control the simple hardware, allowing it
 to be reprogrammed much faster.</p> <br/>

 <h1 style="background-color:Tomato;"><U>History of Visual Basic</U></h1>
 
 <P> Visual Basic is a third-generation event-driven programming language from Microsoft known for its 
 Component Object Model (COM) programming model first released in 1991
 and declared legacy during 2008. Microsoft intended Visual Basic to be relatively easy to learn and use. 
 Visual Basic was derived from BASIC and enables the rapid application development (RAD) of graphical user interface (GUI) 
 applications, access to databases using Data Access Objects, Remote Data Objects, or ActiveX Data Objects,
 and creation of ActiveX controls and objects.
 A programmer can create an application using the components provided by the Visual Basic program itself.
 Over time the community of programmers developed third-party components.
 Programs written in Visual Basic can also use the Windows API, which requires external function declarations.
 
The final release was version 6 in 1998 (now known simply as Visual Basic).
 On April 8, 2008, Microsoft stopped supporting Visual Basic 6.0 IDE.
 The Microsoft Visual Basic team still maintains compatibility for Visual Basic 6.0 applications on Windows Vista, 
 Windows Server 2008 including R2, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows 10, Windows Server 2016,
 and Windows Server 2019 through its "It Just Works" program.[8] In 2014, 
 some software developers still preferred Visual Basic 6.0 over its successor, Visual Basic .NET. In 2014 some developers lobbied for a new version of the VB6 programming environment.In 2016,
 Visual Basic 6.0 won the technical impact award at The 19th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards. A dialect of Visual Basic, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), 
 is used as a macro or scripting language within several Microsoft and ISV applications, including Microsoft Office. <p/> <br/>

 <p><h4 style="color:Tomato;">SCADA systems have evolved through four generations as follows</h4>
<h3><u>First generation: "Monolithic"</u></h3>
Early SCADA system computing was done by large minicomputers. 
Common network services did not exist at the time SCADA was developed. 
Thus SCADA systems were independent systems with no connectivity to other systems. 
The communication protocols used were strictly proprietary at that time. 
The first-generation SCADA system redundancy was achieved using a back-up mainframe system connected to all
 the Remote Terminal Unit sites and was used in the event of failure of the primary mainframe system.
 Some first generation SCADA systems were developed as "turn key" operations that ran on minicomputers 
 such as the PDP-11 series.[citation needed].
<H3><U>Second generation: "Distributed"</U></H3>
SCADA information and command processing were distributed across multiple stations which were connected through a LAN. 
Information was shared in near real time. Each station was responsible for a particular task, 
which reduced the cost as compared to First Generation SCADA. The network protocols used were still not standardized. 
Since these protocols were proprietary, 
very few people beyond the developers knew enough to determine how secure a SCADA installation was.
Security of the SCADA installation was usually overlooked.
<h3><u>Third generation: "Networked"</u></h3>
Similar to a distributed architecture, 
any complex SCADA can be reduced to the simplest components and connected through communication protocols.
 In the case of a networked design, 
 the system may be spread across more than one LAN network called a process control network (PCN) and separated 
 geographically. Several distributed architecture SCADAs running in parallel, with a single supervisor and historian, 
 could be considered a network architecture. This allows for a more cost-effective solution in very large scale systems.
<h3><u>Fourth generation: "Web-based"</u></h3>
The growth of the internet has led SCADA systems to implement web technologies allowing users to view data,
 exchange information and control processes from anywhere in the world.
 The early 2000s saw the proliferation of Web SCADA systems.
 Web SCADA systems use internet browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox as the graphical user 
 interface (GUI) for the operators HMI. This simplifies the client side installation and 
 enables users to access the system from various platforms with web browsers such as servers, 
 personal computers, laptops, tablets and mobile phones.<p/>

   <h1 style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;"><U>History of P.H.P</U></h1><br/> <br/>
  <p>PHP is an "HTML-embedded scripting language" primarily used for dynamic Web applications. 
  The first part of this definition means that PHP code can be interspersed with HTML, 
  making it simple to generate dynamic pieces of Web pages on the fly. As a scripting language, 
  PHP code requires the presence of the PHP processor. 
  PHP code is normally run in plain-text scripts that will only run on PHP-enabled computers
  (conversely programming languages can create standalone binary executable files, a.k.a. programs).
  PHP takes most of its syntax from C, Java, and Perl. 
  It is an open source technology and runs on most operating systems and with most Web servers. 
  PHP was written in the C programming language by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 for use in monitoring his
  online resume and related personal information. For this reason, PHP originally stood for "Personal Home Page".
  Lerdorf combined PHP with his own Form Interpreter, releasing the combination publicly as PHP/FI (generally referred 
  to as PHP 2.0) on June 8, 1995. Two programmers, Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, 
  rebuilt PHP's core, releasing the updated result as PHP/FI 2 in 1997. The acronym was formally changed to PHP:
  HyperText Preprocessor, at this time. 
  (This is an example of a recursive acronym: where the acronym itself is in its own definition.) In 1998,
  PHP 3 was released, which was the first widely used version. PHP 4 was released in May 2000, with a new core,
  known as the Zend Engine 1.0. PHP 4 featured improved speed and reliability over PHP 3. In terms of features,
  PHP 4 added references, the Boolean type, COM support on Windows, output buffering, many new array functions, 
  expanded object-oriented programming, inclusion of the PCRE library, and more. Maintenance releases of PHP 4 are
  still available, primarily for security updates.  PHP 5 was released in July 2004,<p/>
