<p>

Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie was an American computer scientist who “helped shape the digital era”.
 He created the C programming language and with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system. 
 Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, 
 the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Clinton in 1999.
 Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007.</p> <br/>

<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"><U>2.Niklaus Wirth</U></h1>
<p>

Niklaus Emil Wirth is a Swiss computer scientist who is regarded as a pioneer of computer programming among 
other fields in software engineering. He is best known for designing several programming languages,
 including the highly popular Pascal, Euler, Algol W, Modula, Modula-2, Oberon, Oberon-2, and Oberon-07. 
 He also designed the simple programming language PL/0 to illustrate compiler design which formed the basis
 for many university compiler design classes.
Niklaus had previously worked on part of the design and implementation team for the Lilith 
and Oberon operating systems as well as the Lola digital hardware design and simulation system. 
Wirth’s pioneering work and development of innovative computer languages helped him win the prestigious
 Turing Award in 1984.</p> <br/>

<p>

Arguably one of the most popular computer programmers of all time, 
Bill Gates is an American business magnate, computer programmer,
 PC pioneer, investor, and philanthropist. He is the co-founder, 
 ex-executive officer and current chairman of Microsoft, which is the world’s 
 largest personal-computer software company. He is the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer
 revolution and helped develop Windows, which is the most used operating system in the world.
For the first 5 years at Microsoft, aside from handling the business side of the company,
 Gates also personally oversaw every single code that the company sent out, often fixing ones he deemed incorrect or
 buggy. Aside from his programming skills, he is widely praised for his generosity and keen investment planning, 
 but is highly criticized due to his anti-competitive business tactics.</p> <br/>

Linus Benedict Torvalds is a Finnish American software engineer,
 who was the principal force behind the development of the Linux kernel.
 He later became the chief architect of the Linux kernel, and now acts as the project’s coordinator.
 He also created the revision control system Git as well as the diving log software Subsurface. He was honored,
 along with Shinya Yamanaka, with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology Academy 
 Finland in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating system for computers leading to the widely
 used Linux kernel.</p> <br/>

<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"><U>James Gosling</U></h1>
<p>

James Arthur Gosling is a Canadian computer scientist and an officer of the order of Canada.
 He has coded quite a number of programs but is widely known for his creation of the highly successful and commonly
 used Java programming language in 1994 as well as its original virtual machine and compiler. He credits his creation 
 towards his graduate student days where he created a p-code virtual machine for the lab’s DEC VAX computer,
 so that his professor could run UCSD Pascal programs and then realized that the architecture-neutral execution 
 for widely distributed programs could be achieved by a similar technique.
James has also made major contributions to several other software systems,
 such as NeWS and Gosling Emacs. Due to his extra-ordinary achievements Gosling was elected 
 to Foreign Associate member of the United States National Academy of Engineering.</p> <br/>

<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"><U>Guido van Rossum</U></h1>
<p>Guido van Rossum is a Dutch computer programmer who is the author of the popular
 Python programming language that is wildly used today. His creation of Python lead
 him to being declared a “Benevolent Dictator For Life” the In the Python community
 which means that he continues to oversee the Python development process, making decisions where necessary, forever.

Rossum had developed Python while working at Google, where he also created Mondrian
 (a code review system internally used by the Google) and Rietveld. After working for 
 Google for 7 years, he is now working at Dropbox. Rossum has been recognized as a 
 distinguished engineer by the Association for Computing Machinery and also received the NLUUG Award in May 2003.</p> <br/>

<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"><U>Rasmus Lerdorf</U></h1>
<p>Rasmus Lerdorf (born 22 November 1968) is a Danish-Canadian programmer. 
He co-authored and inspired the PHP scripting language, authoring the first two versions
 of the language and participating in the development of later versions led by a group
 of developers including Jim Winstead (who later created blo.gs), Stig Bakken, Shane Caraveo,
 Andi Gutmans, and Zeev Suraski. He continues to contribute to the project.
 From September 2002 to November 2009 Lerdorf was employed by Yahoo! Inc.
 as an Infrastructure Architecture Engineer. In 2010, he joined WePay in 
 order to develop their application programming interface. Throughout 
 2011 he was a roving consultant for startups. On 22 February 2012 he announced on Twitter that he had joined Etsy.
 In July, 2013 Rasmus joined Jelastic as a senior advisor to help them with the creation of new technology.
Lerdorf is a frequent speaker at Open Source conferences around the world.
 During his keynote presentation at OSCMS 2007, he presented a security vulnerability 
 in each of the projects represented at the conference that year.
Lerdorf also appeared at the WeAreDevelopers Conferences 2017 and 2019,
 making a speech on the history of PHP, the new PHP 7 release in 2017, and the 25 years of PHP.
