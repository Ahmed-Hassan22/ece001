<h1 style="color:O;"><strong> Programming Language</strong></h1>
 
	<p> Programming language is important because it defines the relationship, semantics and grammar which allows the programmers to effectively
	communicate with the machines that they program.

A programming language serves several purposes
You can instruct the computer what to do in a human-readable form
Allows the programmer to structure the instructions into functions, procedures, etc.
This also allows the program to be broken into "chunks" which can be developed by a group of developers

Provides portability - the low-level instructions of one computer will be different from that of another computer.
 

Computer programmers have a full understanding of the how and why of computer systems, including system limitations,
 and can set realistic expectations and work around those limitations to fully maximize the use of the equipment and its accessories.

     Programming, especially in web development, has allowed new interactive web applications that have access to 
	 system resources and provide the same level of control as desktop applications. Used on online learning platforms,
	 these applications have allowed distance-learning programs to take off. Today, almost all major learning institutions have 
	 some form of online learning implementation, thanks to computer programming.

      Computer programming principles implemented today will likely influence how technologies such as voice-recognition,
	  artificial intelligence and other sophisticated technologies will change in the future and how they will be applied
	  to our day-to-day lives. For example, the trend toward automating Internet searches and purchases to be more localized is ongoing.
	  While the hardware platforms developed will play a major role, computer technology will likely be at the center of it all and programming
	  future systems will be an important aspect.

No matter what type of job a computer programmer fulfills, he/she will have general responsibilities to perform in their role
 as computer programmer. The first is to develop new computer programming methods. These may include anywhere from basic computer
 programming methods to more in-depth methods. Another general responsibility which a computer programmer must undertake in his/her daily
 job role is the development of programs themselves. This is an extremely important concept associated with the role of a computer
 programmer as these are the individuals who construct the useful programs which are used by many.

Another general responsibility of a computer programmer is to consult with outside parties in relation to the construction of 
computer programming methods and the programs themselves. Lastly, computer programmers must follow the progress of programs to ensure that 
they are operating correctly and fix any program errors that might occur along the way.

First thing what is computer programming? It’s nothing but a sequence of instructions to enable the computer to do something.
 It does because if you are working in IT Company (after your graduation) then the thing which matters is: "How can you save 
 the efforts of other people (Customers) so that they will reward you". You can do this only if you automate the process which individual have to perform manually. This can be done by programming only.

So what you are thinking. It’s still unclear to you.

Knowledge of computer programming habituates your mind to thinking in a sensible, common sense manner
 and that approach will benefit anyone in the information technology field. The ability to think rationally 
 and use logic  when making decisions in.

Today, most people don't need to know how a computer works.  Most people can simply turn on a computer or 
a mobile phone and point at some little graphical object on the display, click a button or swipe a finger or two, and the computer does something.
  An example would be to get weather information from the net and display it.  How to interact with a computer
  program is all the average person needs to know.  </p>
